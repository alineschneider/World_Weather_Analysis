# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
The project consisted of:
- Retrieving world weather data through API calls; 
- Analyzing the data using Linear Regression to find the relationship between variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, latitude); and 
- The creation of an app including heatmaps (using Google API) and functionality that allows customers to know the weather in the cities when they click on a pop-up marker, as wel as directions between multiple cities for travel.
